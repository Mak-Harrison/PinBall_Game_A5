# PinBall_Game_A5
Welcome to pinball, your goal is to keep the ball from going though the flippers and getting the highest points. Push space bar to activate the spring to eject the ball into the game. Then you will use the left and right arrows for the flippers to keep the ball in play. Watch out for the bumper circles and arrows as they will trigger the ball to have a reaction if collide.
